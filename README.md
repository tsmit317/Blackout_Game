### Gameplay
BLACKOUT incorporates a puzzle structure into its gameplay. Currently the game only consists of only two levels. The objective of each level is to successfully traverse and unlock the door to the next level. To do so, the user must figure out a way around obstacles and enemies through the use of levers. These levers are placed throughout the each level and interact with various objects when activated in a specific order.

Since players may find themselves dying numerous times before making it through a level, and to prevent someone from rage quitting, there is not a set amount of lives. When a player dies, they respawn at the previous checkpoint.
